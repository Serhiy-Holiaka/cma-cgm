                        Shipping heavy equipment, industrial machinery, or fragile and oversized cargo requires special
                        expertise. Oversized cargo is cargo that is unusually large and cannot be shipped in a standard
                        container. Our specialist teams are on hand to help you ship any type of oversized product
                        anywhere in the world. We can mix and match our end-to-end, bespoke solutions and our loading
                        and unloading capacity at 420 ports with versatile and flexible service offerings to deliver a
                        secure service.
