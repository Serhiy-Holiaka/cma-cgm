                        The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has amended the SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea)
                        convention under regulation 2 of chapter VI which mandates the declaration of the Verified Gross
                        Mass (VGM) of a packed container before loading on board vessels within a prescribed cut-off
                        date / time to the shipping line and / or port terminal authorities. Effective 1st July 2016,
                        the regulation stipulates the use of two approved methods to declare the VGM for each container
                        by the shipper or his representative. As per the regulation, either of the two approved methods
                        must be used to declare the verified gross mass:
